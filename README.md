# bcgov-build-page-layout

layout the build page so that:

There is a section for each view mode
Each of these sections shows the fields in that view mode. this should be the label and the value of the field. If there is no value, it should be label with optional or required beside it
each section should have an edit link that looks like a button
clicking edit takes me to the form mode for that section

**Task**

Using the Figma prototype as a guide, develop the build page for data catalogue editors.
